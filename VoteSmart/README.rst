address methods

and ``getOffice(candidateId)`` all return a list of ``Address`` objects based on
the provided election or candidate id.

    235 Cannon House Office Building Washington DC

``getCampaignWebAddress(candidateId)`` and ``getOfficeWebAddress(candidateId)``
return a list of ``WebAddress`` objects based on the provided election or
candidate id.

* ``getByLevenstein(lastName, electionYear=None)``
* ``getByElection(electionId)``
* ``getByDistrict(districtId, electionYear=None)``
* ``getByZip(zip5, zip4=None)``

All six methods return a list containing one or more Candidate objects.

You will notice that several candidates appear twice, this is due to an
unfortunate issue with the Vote Smart API where candidates with multiple
parties, or election statuses are duplicated.  Be careful when consuming
candidate data to dedupe using the fields you find useful.
