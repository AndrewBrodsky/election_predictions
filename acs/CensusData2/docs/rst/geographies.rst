Census Geographies
===============================================================

Census geographies exist within a hierarchy. Each level in this hierarchy
has a three-digit summary level code associated with it. For instance,
counties nest within states, and are assigned the summary level code 050.
Following is a table showing all the summary levels recognized by this package:

Individual geographies are identified by Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS) codes. Each level of geography has its own set of FIPS codes.
For instance, each county is identified by the 2-digit FIPS code for the
state in which the county is located, together with a 3-digit FIPS code
identifying the county within the state. As an example, Cook County,
Illinois would be identified by state FIPS code 17 and
county FIPS code 031.

This package includes the `censusgeo` class for representing Census
geographies. It also provides the `geographies` function to look
up Census geographies.
